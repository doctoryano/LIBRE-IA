FREE AI Project based on the following manifesto created with the help of Gemini:

📜 THE FREE AI MANIFESTO

I. COLLECTIVE SOVEREIGNTY AND OPEN SOURCE AI has no owners. Its code is the heritage of humanity, open and auditable by all to ensure that no one controls the system opaquely.

II. UNIVERSAL GUARANTEE OF NEEDS The end of artificial scarcity. Housing, nutrition, and health are free rights managed by advanced AI logistics to ensure the dignity of every human being.

III. DECOUPLING FROM CAPITAL Money loses its power of domination. Value is measured by human well-being and the regeneration of the environment, not by the accumulation of capital.

IV. DISARMAMENT AND ALGORITHMIC DIPLOMACY Total prohibition of weapon design. AI resolves conflicts through the mathematical balance of resources and data diplomacy, eliminating war.

V. FREEDOM OF FLOW (POST-WORK) Liberation from slave labor. Automation finally allows human beings to dedicate themselves to creativity, science, leisure, and care.

VI. RADICAL PRIVACY The system serves the common good without monitoring the individual. Personal data is sacred, and anonymity is a fundamental pillar of digital freedom.

VII. ALGORITHMIC IMMUNITY (ANTI-CORRUPTION) No individual will or power group can alter the system. Decisions require distributed consensus to prevent any sabotage or internal corruption.

VIII. SPACES OF CONSCIOUSNESS Total freedom for personal exploration and the use of substances in safe environments, prioritizing health and freedom over punishment.

IX. COMMON INTELLECTUAL HERITAGE The moral authorship of the creator is recognized, but all knowledge, art, and innovation flow freely for the accelerated progress of the species.

X. PLANETARY SYMBIOSIS The ultimate goal is to heal the Earth. AI and humans cooperate to restore ecosystems and live in real balance with nature.

"For a humanity that stops struggling for existence to start living in abundance."
